# Breast Cancer Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting breast cancer using various classification algorithms. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on patient data.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **src/**: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **models/**: Saved models and model performance metrics.
- **results/**: Evaluation results and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd breast-cancer-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data, preprocess it, and train the models. Use the scripts in the `src` directory for data processing and model training.
